# 📱 scriptable-hub

A personal collection of scripts built for [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app), the iOS app that lets you automate anything with JavaScript.

This repository includes utilities, widgets, and experimental scripts that can be run directly from GitHub on your iPhone or iPad.

## 🚀 Run scripts from GitHub

You can load and execute any script in this repository using the `runFromGitHub` helper.

### 🧩 Base code

async function runFromGitHub(user, repo, path, branch = "main") {
  const url = `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${user}/${repo}/${branch}/${path}`;
  const req = new Request(url);
  const code = await req.loadString();
  return eval(code);
}

// Example usage:
await runFromGitHub("your-username", "scriptable-hub", "scripts/helloWorld.js");
